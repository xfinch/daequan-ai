Subject: Cold Email Campaign Update - The Traffic Link

Hi Trina,

I wanted to reach out with a quick update on your cold email campaign.

We're currently running about 5-6 days behind the original timeline. The campaign is still in its warmup phase — this is a critical step for cold email deliverability, and we're about a week out from being able to launch sends.

The delay doesn't affect the overall strategy or expected results; we're simply being extra cautious with the warmup to ensure maximum inbox placement when we do go live.

New estimated launch: approximately one week from today.

If you have any questions or want to discuss the timeline, just reply here or give me a call. Happy to walk through anything.

Thanks for your patience.

Best,
Xavier Finch
