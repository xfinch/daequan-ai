So the traffic link and assistable work in the sense that the traffic link at some point kind of acts as an agency or maybe we are a white label of aficionados and we were using the technology behind assistable to give us what I call Travis AI,
which is basically if I connected a phone number to Daquan and then Daquan answered all my questions.
In fact, I think at one point in time, I'm going to try to replace assistable with you, Daquan.
We got here. The reason why I'm not at NASDAQ anymore is because they fired me.
I couldn't keep up with the demand of the team that I was on and they let me go.
They laid me off, said I wasn't keeping up and as a result, they had to make a decision.
