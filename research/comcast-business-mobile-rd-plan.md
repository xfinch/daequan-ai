## 1. DEFINE / DISCOVER THE NEED

### Primary Pain Points
| Pain Point | Business Impact | Comcast Solution |
|------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Fragmented billing** | Multiple vendors, separate invoices, accounting overhead | Single bill for internet + mobile |
| **Inconsistent support** | "Not our problem" finger-pointing between providers | One support team, one throat to choke |
| **Coverage gaps** | Dead zones at work sites, dropped client calls | Comcast + Verizon network partnership |
| **BYOD security risks** | Personal devices on business networks, data exposure | Business-managed lines with security controls |
| **Overpaying on consumer plans** | Businesses on consumer T-Mobile/Verizon paying premium | Business pricing with unlimited options |

### Specific Use Cases
1. **Field service businesses** (HVAC, plumbing, construction)
   - Need: Reliable mobile at job sites + mobile hotspot backup
   - Pain: Separate internet + mobile bills, no integration

2. **Multi-location retail/restaurants**
   - Need: Consistent connectivity across stores, mobile POS backup
   - Pain: Managing different providers per location

3. **Professional services** (law, accounting, real estate)
   - Need: Professional image, reliable client communication
   - Pain: Consumer plans lack business features (caller ID, voicemail-to-email)

4. **Delivery/logistics companies**
   - Need: Fleet management, driver tracking, reliable comms
   - Pain: Consumer plans don't scale, no business support

### Discovery Questions for Sales Calls
- "How many mobile lines does your team use for business?"
- "Are you getting separate bills for internet and mobile?"
- "Ever had a dead zone cost you a client or delay a job?"
- "Who handles your mobile support when something breaks?"
- "What would change if internet and mobile were on one bill?"

## 2. POTENTIAL MARKET

### Addressable Market (Estimates)
| Segment | Est. Size | Priority |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Comcast Business Internet customers with 5-20 employees | ~500K-1M | **HIGH** |
| Multi-location businesses (2-5 sites) | ~150K | **HIGH** |
| Field service companies | ~200K | MEDIUM |
| Home-based businesses | ~1M+ | LOW (consumer overlap) |

### Geographic Sweet Spots
- Major metros: Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Atlanta, Miami
- Secondary markets: Where Comcast has strong internet presence but mobile adoption is lower
- Opportunity: Markets where Comcast recently expanded fiber infrastructure

### High-Value Segments
1. **Construction/Trades** - High mobile dependency, value reliability over price
2. **Healthcare clinics** - HIPAA considerations, need business-grade security
3. **Property management** - Multiple sites, need consistent service across portfolio
4. **Transportation/Logistics** - Fleet management, high line counts per business

## 3. EARNING POTENTIAL

### Commission Structure (Industry Standards - Verify with Comcast)
| Metric | Est. Value | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Upfront commission per line | $50-$150 | Varies by plan type |
| Residual commission | 5-15% of monthly bill | Ongoing as long as customer stays |
| Average lines per SMB | 8-15 | Mix of basic smartphones + tablets |
| Average monthly bill per line | $40-$70 | Business unlimited plans |
| **Commission per 10-line deal** | **$500-$1,500 upfront + $200-$1,050/month residual** | |
| Annual value per deal | $2,900-$14,100 | Year 1 (including residuals) |

### Revenue Scenarios
| Activity Level | Deals/Month | Lines/Deal | Year 1 Earnings |
|----------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| Conservative (5 deals) | 5 | 8 | $14,500-$56,400 |
| Moderate (10 deals) | 10 | 10 | $29,000-$141,000 |
| Aggressive (20 deals) | 20 | 12 | $69,600-$338,400 |

### Upsell vs. New Customer Value
- **Internet-only customer**: One-time sale, potential churn
- **Internet + Mobile**: 40-60% higher lifetime value, significantly lower churn (bundling effect)
- Mobile customers are 3x less likely to switch internet providers

### Account Penetration Opportunity
Existing customer base with mobile elsewhere = immediate opportunity:
- No acquisition cost (already paying for internet)
- Trust established (internet service working)
- Easier approval process (existing credit relationship)

## KEY DIFFERENTIATORS FOR COMCAST BUSINESS MOBILE

### Unique Selling Propositions
1. **Network Reliability**: Runs on Verizon + Comcast's own infrastructure
2. **One Bill**: Internet + Mobile consolidated
3. **Business-First Support**: Not an afterthought like consumer carriers
4. **Xfinity WiFi Hotspots**: Automatic connection to millions of hotspots (data savings)
5. **Flexibility**: Month-to-month options vs. long contracts
6. **Local Presence**: Comcast has local offices, not just phone support

### Objection Handling
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Verizon has better coverage" | "We use Verizon's network PLUS Xfinity hotspots. You're getting the best of both." |
| "T-Mobile is cheaper" | "Let's look at your total cost — separate bills, time managing vendors, support hassles. What's that worth?" |
| "We're in a contract" | "When does it end? Let's schedule a review 60 days before. Early termination fees often offset by our savings." |
| "We only have 3 lines" | "Perfect size to start. Easy to add lines as you grow, all on one bill." |
| "Mobile isn't a priority" | "Understood. One question: How many sales or clients have you lost to a dropped call?" |
