**Summary:**
## Meeting Information
> Date: 2026-02-19 14:05:27
> Location: [Insert Location]
> Participants: [Speaker 1] [Speaker 2] [Speaker 3] [Speaker 4] [Speaker 5] [Speaker 6] [Speaker 7]
## Meeting Notes
- Topic Title: Pricing dispute and customer retention for Eastside Liquor/Laker store
  - The team discussed losing a liquor store opportunity due to price concerns; the customer prioritized the lowest upfront cost.
  - Customer claimed an email showed a lower price ($94/month for “150”), and a friend had better pricing.
  - [Speaker 2] requested proof of the lower price to reconcile; emphasized the current offer balances cost and service quality.
  - [Speaker 1] proposed offering $94/month for the 150 plan after a “manager check,” positioning the manager as the “bad cop.”
  - Clarified “150” is likely around $94/month; plan names tie to internal flashcards.
  - Conclusion: [Speaker 2] will consider calling the customer back with the $94 offer after consulting the manager narrative.
- Topic Title: Salesforce task hygiene to protect leads
  - Guidance to update tasks daily and use recurring tasks every 12 days to prevent lead theft by the call center.
  - Demonstrated creating a “Follow up call” task under Open Activities and setting a recurring series ending in ~2.5 months.
  - Strategy: Click “X” to mark tasks complete daily and add brief notes to protect the lead (e.g., “Still working with the customer on timelines”).
  - Created/adjusted an “opportunity view” with key fields: opportunity number, name, expected close date, stage, order status, last modified date, email nurture opt-out, duration limit expiration date.
  - Tip: Sort by Last Modified Date; anything older than 12 days likely lacks a recurring task.
  - Note: One lead might have shown another rep’s name; vigilance required.
- Topic Title: Ensuring Email Nurture Opt-out is set on opportunities
  - When creating an opportunity, always check “email nurture opt-out.”
  - Some existing opportunities lacked this setting; it will be included in the custom view for monitoring.
- Topic Title: Training, tech ride-along, and field readiness
  - Plan a tech ride-along, typically Thursdays; target next Thursday.
  - [Speaker 2] is in Velocity training (week 4–5); eager to start field work.
  - Post-training plan: hit the field and phones; learn Secretary of State site, liquor lists, Tacoma business licenses.
  - All-hands meeting: in person, Wednesday at 9 a.m. in Seattle; may take precedence over Velocity (to be confirmed with Sharnae).
  - Conclusion: Proceed with scheduling the ride-along and coordinate all-hands vs. Velocity attendance.
- Topic Title: PrintPoint bulk mailers and local marketing campaigns
  - Proposal: Pre-canvas territory with mailers so visits follow shortly after delivery.
  - Idea: “Meet Xavier, your new Comcast guy” mailer.
  - PrintPoint training on Monday the second; can upload Excel addresses and send bulk mailers with rep info.
  - Marketing mix: mailers, in-person drop-ins, follow-up texts/calls, potentially a monthly newsletter.
  - Goal: Build a book of business, maintain consistent presence, and run structured campaigns tied to seasonal needs.
- Topic Title: Mail merge outreach (internal process)
  - Internal “mail merge” sends individualized emails from Excel lists (avoid using the term publicly).
  - Suggested cadence: ~300 emails weekly to cycle through a list every six weeks; can yield a few sales per month.
  - Plan sessions with Holden to set up mail merge for [Speaker 2], a new colleague, and Will.
  - Action to locate Cheyenne’s prior merge list via Susan if available.
- Topic Title: Pricing flashcards and offer structure
  - Access to official flashcards was denied; [Speaker 1] sent the most recent file directly.
  - Definitions:
    - Single play: internet only.
    - Multiplay: internet + 1 phone line (each extra phone line is $25; phone lines add taxes).
  - Price relationships: Multiplay is typically $15 more than the corresponding single play for the same speed/term.
  - Offer types:
    - Sales/QVP vs. Standard vs. Premium (loyalty/renewal).
    - Standard may include Connection Pro (avoid selling; prefer Wireless Connect).
    - Security Edge Preferred bundles forthcoming for better commission multipliers.
  - Gift cards: Not available on Sale UVP; available on Standard (but Standard is ~$30 more—consider tradeoffs).
  - Early termination: ~$35 per month remaining (lower than many telecoms).
  - Conclusion: [Speaker 2] understands basic reading of flashcards and will practice to gain fluency.
- Topic Title: Field operations and door-knocking
  - Plan to door-knock with [Speaker 1] Wednesday after all-hands.
  - Ensure pre-checks of customer services and naming conventions are understood; [Speaker 2] is improving fluency.
- Topic Title: Equipment and work setup
  - [Speaker 2] uses multiple monitors; lacks a dock/switcher and notes laptop battery limitations.
  - Recommendation: keep devices plugged in while working from home.
## Next Arrangements
- [ ] Call the liquor store contact to offer $94/month for the 150 plan after the “manager check” positioning.
- [ ] Create recurring follow-up tasks (every 12 days) for all active opportunities; set end dates ~2.5 months out.
- [ ] Complete daily tasks: click “X” on tasks and add brief protective notes.
- [ ] Verify “email nurture opt-out” is checked on all opportunities.
- [ ] Set up a custom opportunity view and sort by Last Modified Date; fix any records older than 12 days.
- [ ] Schedule the tech ride-along for next Thursday.
- [ ] Confirm Wednesday 9 a.m. all-hands attendance and priority vs. Velocity training with Sharnae; inform trainers of any conflicts.
- [ ] Attend PrintPoint training on Monday the second; prepare an address list for mailers.
- [ ] Coordinate mail merge setup sessions with Holden for [Speaker 2], the new colleague, and Will.
- [ ] Ask Susan if Cheyenne’s mail merge list is available; retrieve if possible.
- [ ] Obtain and study the latest pricing flashcards; practice offer naming and structures.
- [ ] Plan the door-knocking route for Wednesday after all-hands; pre-check prospects’ current services.
- [ ] Acquire a dock/HDMI switcher to improve home workstation reliability; keep devices plugged in.
- [ ] [Insert more]
## AI Suggestions
> AI Suggestions
> AI has identified the following issues that were not concluded in the meeting or lack clear action items; please pay attention:
> 1. Confirm the exact plan details behind “150 at $94/month” and whether this aligns with current flashcards and allowed discounting for this customer.
> 2. Resolve the lead ownership confusion (appearance of another rep’s name); verify the current owner and ensure task protection is active.
> 3. Fix access permissions to official flashcards/MySource: persistent “Access denied” needs IT/support resolution to avoid reliance on shared files.
> 4. Clarify all-hands vs. Velocity training precedence: confirm with Sharnae and inform trainers to avoid scheduling conflicts.
> 5. Ensure compliance around mail merge and bulk outreach: adhere to internal policies, including limits (e.g., 400–500/week) and phrasing guidance.

00:00:01
But you can find out about his business, you know. Um, actually, I've been even googling. And then when you do reach out, be like, "Hey," you know, "I've got a lot of a lot of my customers need X Y Z." So I'll also be able to probably find some good business for you. Um He, he does seem to like the money, but also just referrals and support for his people. Go a long way. Okay So yeah, Sheum. It's yeah, I know you didn't take over Mon's territory, but I think you'd be the best fit forum. You know becoming a governor.
00:00:42
Okay. I appreciate you looking out for me. Yeah, I am definitely in a place right now where, I am looking forward to the next couple of weeks. And I think we lost that opportunity for the Laker store. I think at the end of the day, he is just looking for the least least, You know, the least uh, you know least amount of money out the door. And that's understandable being a new business owner. You are trying to you are concerned about costs, Especially when you don't know what the future looks like, and that location isn't like, he's in a seriously high traffic location. So I understood I expressed my understanding of cost cost concerns especially being new, Um but that we are offering him the best prices out there for what he is trying to accomplish.
00:01:29
And, and he got kind of pissed that I. He felt like there was a he said there was an email, That came out that had a lower price and that his friend had a lower price. Then,
00:01:39
When I was remember. 
00:01:41
How I mentioned like do we want to put it on one fifty there too, as well, right? So so that is something that you know, it's it's a risk you takeum if there is a better price out there, we didn't give it to him. Uh.
00:01:54
I asked him to provide me with the proof that, uh show me where he where he saw that that price. And that I could work with him from there, but as it sits right now, We're giving them the best opportunity to to save the most amount of money for the quality of service. He needs. And and he and he kind of got upset with me. And I was like, uh, I was like, man, look, it isn't like I can negotiate your price. Like you either you like it or you don't You know. 
00:02:24
Right, yeah, I guess that's what we did because I bet if we had have included the hundred and fifties, he would have gone for it. I mean,
00:02:30
How much is one hundred and fifty? I guess I could look. I try to look at. And that was the other thing i like, i found i was like trying to go back to that. Go back to the message you sent me on Monday, where I can look at the the The rate cards, the flashcards, but they were not pulling up.
00:02:48
Okay. Yeah, okay. Right. I think it's like a ninety four bucks a month or something for one hundred and fifty.
00:02:53
I think that's the one that he was talking about. Was like ninety four. That's the one he wanted was ninety four dollars. I mean, I could call him back and be like," Hey, I had i finally got a chance to talk to my manager. Ninety four dollars if that if that works for you." You know, then we can do that.
00:03:07
Um yeah, And if you do, i would I would like i'd call him and just be like," Hey, I talked with my manager asking like what the crap's going on? How come he's getting he's getting better deals?" Yeah,
00:03:19
I play the good cop make you the bad cop.
00:03:22
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just because you are new and like how is it possible that he gets an email that's a better deal than I can give? And, my manager showed me the like the deep discounted back end stuff that isn't on our rate card, you know, that isn't on our normal rate card. So sorry about that, dude. And it can be just be like that. Right Do you still do you have it uh Do you have your tasks? I'll show you how to do. Put tasks on there, right? Recurring tasks.
00:03:53
Yes, uh- huh. I got to go today is my day to update my tasks. I have a reminder that I need to go through and update all of my opportunities.
00:04:02
So, um, Do you remember how to do it by on your home page, scrolling down and clicking that little X button? Remember that?
00:04:11
When you say homepage, homepage or what?
00:04:13
Of Salesforce.
00:04:19
Don't know if I absolutely remember that. Okay,
00:04:22
I'll just show you here. We'll pop on a Teams because you should you should be doing that every single day. Like basically the ones that are due will pop up and you do them. But, it's got to be an everyday thing because a once- a- week thing, then you'll have gaps where you're not protected. And if he calls into the call center right now, that lead will get taken from you because it's not updated.
00:04:42
I think I think the lead is already taken from me.
00:04:46
What? You got taken?
00:04:49
I saw I saw Devereaux's name on there.
00:04:54
No, you wouldn't have gotten an email that got flipped. Devereaux is the old the old lady, wasn't it? Or did she did it get flipped? Um, Here, let's get on a uh, let's get on a call. And uh, I'll show you how to do that, because that is something that you got to be doing every single day.
00:05:19
I'll call again.
00:05:26
You could here. You could definitely play that card of like, hey, I asked my manager what the crap. How can other people how can how can three better? How can one part of the company have better deals than I have? And he showed me the back end stuff.
00:05:43
So, I would definitely do that. Uh so let's go.

00:13:45
Um, I mean okay, Are you can take notes on this if you want or we can do another time? Butum So really all you need. Is. Subject follow up. You don't even need the type. Um, and then keep it on new, choose the due date of today. It's gonna be like the first one. And then why is that not working? It's supposed to work.
00:14:21
Probably didn't tap hard enough. 
00:14:25
And then okay, so you remember what's next?
00:14:32
And save it. Oh, did you just say save a new task? No. What did you just say?
00:14:40
Um, there's the so the other one is uh create recurring tasks.
00:14:45
Oh series of tasks okay yeah.
00:14:46
Yeah yeah. And thenum. 
00:14:51
And then we're going to do weekly?
00:14:53
No no no, Every twelve days.
00:14:55
Every twelve days, that's right. That's right.
00:14:58
Now I have to have you hold on for just a bit. My wife's calling after planning for a funeral, so I gotta make sure I get it. Hey girl. Yeah, no, no okay, I'm in a meeting but but everything go good? Okay good, I gave the boys some oatmeal and uh yeah no okay love you. Hey gentlemen! You get your your schoolwork done? So, Mama's heading home. She'll be home in thirty minutes. It's okay, So and then you choose a recurrence end date about two and a half months out. Don't hit calculate last date. So, what you would have done if you had hit calculate last date and save, You would have made for yourself a weekly reminder every day or every eleven days.
00:15:52
For the next five years, four years. So, what do you usually. So, is it too late?
00:16:00
Do I gotta hit refresh or something?
00:16:02
No, no, you're good. You're good. You deleted it. Um, so put the reoccurring end date out two and a half months out.
00:16:11
So let's type it in manually?
00:16:13
Yeah or manually or you can use you can use the calendar. Gotcha But two and a half months out. 
00:16:22
Or you know, a month and a week or something. That's not going to be enough. That's less than.
00:16:36
Okay, well my math was bad. My math was trash. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that works.
00:16:42
So now hit save. Yes, that's how to do it. Um and now, On your homepage. So every single day, when you go to your homepage, you know, scroll down until you see and there are your tasks. And you can see there's a task there. So if no one sent one before,
00:17:13
You remember that time?
00:17:14
Yeah. I don't know where it is, what it is. But actually what we'll do next is set up a. 
00:17:20
Oh, you know what it ended up going to Martina. I ended up marking it as closed loss because it was uh somebody that Martina said she was already working with.
00:17:34
Oh, that's right. That's right. Okay, Um so what you'll do every morning is, yeah, you can click out of that is click that X to the to the far far left Yeah. That's going to mark it as complete and take you into a place where you're just going to make a quick note.
00:17:52
So, do you want me to do that now?
00:17:54
Yeah, I clicked on that. And then all you've got to do now if you eventually, you're gonna have ten or fifteen of those. You hold the control, you know, Open up, bring it into a new window, open up the click all of the X's so that they all populate in tabs. And then you just type something in those comments like erase whatever's there.
00:18:19
And type something along the lines of " still working with the customer " or " still waiting on timelines, " or still, um. But, you want it to be generic enough so that you can copy it. And then just paste it on all of your notes. They don't this doesn't have to be this isn't a note for you. This is merely to protect the lead from getting stolen by the call center. So something along the lines of, you know. 
00:18:49
Still working with the customer on timelines. Still working with, and you want to make it every day make it a little bit different, But that day, all of the ones that you do will have the same thing because you'll just copy paste, copy paste, copy paste. Perfect. Okay. Um and now you just hit save. So all you're doing once once you hit that X is typing a comment in and it's just a copy and paste. Gotcha. Um, Yeah, Every day do that and and you will never have an issue with losing a sale to the call center.
00:19:27
Okay, Butum so then I probably need to do that with my other opportunities as well. Okay. Yeah,
00:19:34
Let's let's take a few minutes and create for you an opportunity view. I thought we did this but maybe we didn't. Um so here, I'm gonna go to opportunities. 
00:19:48
You got opportunity pipeline. I'm just going to look at this because maybe I thought we created it. And maybe that's what you named it. Nope, because there's nothing there. Okay, So I'm just going to do this for you, because you will never again do it. It's this one. You will never again do this um in your Comcast career.
00:20:19
That's going to be it,
00:20:20
All right. And then I'm just going to choose all of them. I'm going to bring up my view, choose all the ones that are important. We'll get you a view going and then you will be set.
00:20:40
Just waiting for mine to pop up. I know you don't need this.
00:21:36
Where is it, dude? This isn't even. All. 
00:21:46
Right, so we are adding fields to display under my custom opportunity view. So far we got opportunity number, opportunity name, expected close date, stage, order status, last modified date and email nurture opt- out. Yep.
00:22:05
Duration limit expiration. Duration. 
00:22:13
Limit expiration date, okay?
00:22:17
Yeah, date. Stage, okay? That is a campaign. Campaign.
00:22:44
All right. Okay, so here we go.
00:22:54
So, when you create an op, every time you create an op, The very first thing you want to do, there's two things you want to do. One, you've got to click this email nurture opt- out which is right yeah right there. Always make sure this guy is clicked. That is extra important. Where'd it go? What happened?
00:23:22
Oh, I closed the. Yeah, my bad. Wait a minute, no I didn't.
00:23:27
Looks like you dragged our. Dragged something else on. Yeah, dragged your view.
00:23:33
Yeah, I dragged my view. I'm trying to get you out the way, your picture out the way so I can see what you're doing.
00:23:39
Ahh that hurts man that hurts!
00:23:40
Yeah I know it sucks like it sucks that way, But here we go. Okay, hold on a second. I'm gonna go off camera. Alright, keep on.
00:24:10
You've got a couple of them. Don't have that checked.
00:24:27
Yeah, That's they got you there. I keep falling for it. Let's See.
00:24:39
Are you, uh, am I wait, am I waiting for you to get back on or. 
00:24:42
No You know you can keep going. I can see you. You just can't see me. Just a sec back.
00:24:50
So here's how you get to that view. You'll go to opportunities and even though it says Xavier's opportunities, you're not actually there. This is just the home recent opportunity. This is all the ones you've been working on, so you can go to them quickly, but if you want to see yours, you always got to hit go Gotcha, Um, there's two more. There's a trick to get them. But you always want to make sure that you're doing them first, like the moment you create an opportunity. The other thing is that reoccurring task. You always want to make sure you put that reoccurring task on. Okay. So, What one of the reasons we have this dropdown is that this or have this thing is you can look at the duration limit expiration? No, no, no.
00:25:38
Sorry, last modified date. If, you have a last if you and you actually you want to sort by last modified date, so that the smallest is on top, the earliest is on top. If you've got one that is more than basically twelve days old, right? It means that you know, in the morning, you will have clicked the X on all of your tasks. So everything's up to date, which means. You should have none that are more than twelve days old. So if you see one on there that's twelve days old, That's just a real quick indicator that you don't actually have a task on there. Something went wrong and the task didn't get on there. So that way you can go in and actually do the task. Okay. Um, so that's, that's it. That's going to be your view. That'll, that's the way you can look at all your opportunities all at once.And uh, and that is it. 
00:26:32
So, I need to schedule you for a tech ride along. Yes. Usually we do that on Thursdays, so uh probably next Thursday.
00:26:43
Yes, yes. Cause then I'll be done with I'll be done with training the week following.
00:26:49
Okay, so once you're done with training, I say you hit the field, you hit the phones like we keep we keep on training you, Like we're gonna teach you how to go onto the secretary of state site. Um, you know, like once a week you want to check your liquor list, your secretary of state, your Your Tacoma mug.
00:27:15
Tacoma business licenses. I heard they have yeah. I heard they have weird business licensing rules that are different than other places. So it should be a good and good active list.
00:27:29
Yeah, so I mean that's that's very handy. Um. Yeah, But wellum you know I would say probably for like two weeks before you actually start just start hit hitting the field. I I got your cards yesterday and put them on your desk. Okay, um and yeah,
00:27:49
I want to. I imagine in the beginning, I am going to be out in the field like heavy, heavy, heavy. I like being on the field. Like I am trying to figure out better ways to do this type of stuff, But and coming up with a system or something that I can just log in to do this type of stuff. But, what I was going to say is that when I am out there in the field, I want I wanted to try to get ahead of me getting out there in the field. And maybe tell me if I am thinking too much about this. I almost don't want to tell you. I almost want to just do it and ask for forgiveness later.
00:28:27
No, man, tell me now.
00:28:29
No, no, Nick, don't make me do it.
00:28:33
You gotta tell me right now. You gotta tell me.
00:28:35
Oh, So one of the things I want to do is just like canvas, the territory I am going to be working in primarily and like send out mailers before I get there. And then when i then I can plan it to where if if I send it on Friday, I know they're going to get there by Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest. I can go out there the day of and just like, "Hey, I am in your area. I sent you something in the mail. Did you get it?" No, you didn't get it. Great. Well, I am your guy when it comes down to Comcast business. Wanted to make myself known and so that you can get a chance to meet me. Want to make it, you know, Quick acquaintances, anything that's going on that type of thing. So that when i by the time I get there, they've already had an opportunity to see my face So. What I was thinking is like something that says.
00:29:25
Hey, meet Xavier, your new Comcast guy. Along those lines.
00:29:32
We do have like something called PrintPoint. That's right. Which I think there is actually a training on PrintPoint on Monday might be good for us all to tune in Let's. See and PrintPoint is the kind of thing where you can.
00:29:58
Where'd it go? She wasn't well. They'll have it next week. I mean,
00:30:04
One point for a point. There it is. It's on Monday the second, so uh we should make that a thing that maybe we all go to. You can basically upload an Excel sheet ofum zip of addresses, and then they will send out something with your info on it, whatever you choose. Um, like a bulk mailer kind of.
00:30:28
Yes, perfect. That's exactly what I am talking about. A bulk mailer so that I can do it and I want to run everything in my campaigns because what I am starting to realize and like after following the guys around in their territory, is that there is really a big understated need for marketing, right? Because if the marketing is done right, the sales comes easy. Right, so people know about what's going on, and uh. So I want to try to get I want to try to adopt that and like get in there. And just like put my face out there. One of the things I heard from a couple of the guys is that they have a monthly email list. So that'd be a part of my mix. So I know, you know, you talked to I. Remember I told you a while ago, I said I wanted to bring you like a marketing slash business plan, and part of that is my part of the marketing plan is to. 
00:31:25
Have like structured campaigns, around things that are happening every year, you know, your business is. Are you a business owner that has small kids that comes to work with you. In the summertime, you're probably going to have a hit of. You might need you might experience a hit in broadband because you have more users, You know, things like that, like just to keep try to keep in step with what's currently going on. And then it's being out there. So my mix, my my mix is going to be mailers.
00:31:55
In person drop ins, follow up text messages and calls, and that's kind of that's where I want to start. Those three things and see how far that gets me, and then figure and then expand that to something else like a newsletter. I might even put a newsletter on there as make it four things off the rip. So that I can start to build that. Those. 
00:32:23
Are all great shooting throws.
00:32:26
Oh, I froze. You still there? Yeah, I am still here.
00:32:31
Um, sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. Keep going.
00:32:35
Um, yeah, So that's what I am thinking about doing. So that way we can. I can keep that stream of opportunities coming in just from just from flooding the market, you know, and just and just staying in front of people's faces because that's oftentimes what happens is that they don't see you enough. So they start thinking about. You know, where do I go to get these answers? But if you show it up consistently for them, then they'll know where to turn to and they'll know who to refer. You know how to refer. But the whole, the whole thing is try to build up a book of business and build up a book of people that I personally reached out to and contacted in my zip codes. So I can touch bases with those people multiple times a week, if not multiple times a month. So. 
00:33:22
Those four things that I want to put into place. One of the first things is the mailer, so.
00:33:31
Yeah, we also have like you said a list, a list we call it our mail merge, which don't tell Annie but don't ever mention that name to anybody. It's kind of an Olympia secret and so never say the word mail merge. Some people think it's bulk emailing which you are not supposed to do. It's not bulk emailing, it's sending, Individual emails automating the process, So but you know, you just want don't want to mention that to anybody that you could kill a golden goose if you did that. So don't do that. You only send out about four or five hundred a week max. Um, so like Holden's got about twenty four hundred people in his mail merge list, but he pulled reports and we'll do this with you too. I am wondering if Cheyenne shoot dude come on Cheyenne.
00:34:17
He had a merge list. I wonder if he gave us a copy of it somehow before he left. I'll find out, But basically, Holden can help you pull it and show you how he does it. But basically every week he sends out like three hundred every one time a week, And that way, every six weeks he kind of works through his funnel, so not overwhelming people, but he'll get two or three sales a month just from. With people, hey, are you moving? And we got these specific campaigns like, hey, we got this new you know. We got a cell phone deal going on or hey we got. That's uh.
00:34:59
My camera keeps turning off. Yeah that's weird. I think it's because I have a microphone in the camera. And it think I think it thinks I want to use that microphone. And because it can't use that microphone, it just kills the whole everything.
00:35:16
Oh, gotcha. Interesting.
00:35:19
Dude, I do not know how to fix that.
00:35:21
No, you don't. So yeah, I will. So don't worry about it. I got it.
00:35:25
Okay, good. Um, so we'll just start start down that road, and we'll start start getting stuff together. I'll find out if Cheyenne had a mail merge on the while, she asks Susan if she left it with him. 
00:35:40
In a mail merge since from our.
00:35:45
Our email address, Yeah. We're basically uploading an Excel sheet into a template that sends out these emails. And so, I am going to have actually you and the new girl and Will probably have a session with Holden to set that up.
00:36:12
I have missed a number of calls while we've been chatting. Oh, I must call them back. Okay, um, but I don't want to leave you hanging. Anything else? I think that's kind of what I wanted to tackle with you.
00:36:23
Uh no, I don't think I have anything else, but I definitely am itching to get out there man. I cannot wait. But, i'm also trying to make smart sense of the time that i have now, because this is. Obviously, precious time and I'll never get back again. So I am trying to make it the best and the most efficient as possible.
00:36:48
So you are still in velocity training, right?
00:36:50
Still in velocity, yeah. I am on week five of velocity or week four of velocity, but I am in week five of the training. So I am getting ahead of it.
00:36:59
Yes, what you can do?
00:37:08
Uh, I want you to tell Randy he's got to wait for you. To be ready, I want you both to go down together. So just uh, super focus okay? What? Super focus. But yeah, you guys got to go together. Sorry about that. Um. If because if you if you end up, if you've got free time with your velocity training, then it might be worth just. You feel like you've got a good grasp on how to door knock. Do you know how to check on what someone has beforehand, all that kind of stuff?
00:37:45
Uh, yeah, I to a degree. Yeah, I do. What I am not like really versed in is the flashcard right now, but I am working on integrating that into my into my speech. You know what I'll do? I'll be, I mean, a a song about it. AI and it gets stuck in my memory. And then I'll be out there in the field, singing the song to the customers. Hey, learn this new song. It's called "Best Price for the Five Years of Lock." You want to hear about it? Here it goes. I love it, but no, For real no It's. I'm really trying to get fluent with that, like I understand what needs to be done because I've done this kind of work before. But i what i'm not familiar with is the.
00:38:32
The naming of how Comcast goes about naming things, So that's where I have to get the domain knowledge of is get that knowledge up and then I'll be able to speak freely on it. Like, I was out with Cree Tuesday, and when I was out with him, he turned to me he was like, "Right? Is this what you do?" And I was like, "Boom!" Like soon as he said "right," I was on it. It was like yeah. And, then you have this this and this, but i wasn't calling it like voice edge. You know, i wasn't calling it, but like. You know, security edge. I was just saying that it's the benefit of what it does. So,
00:39:09
You'll get it'll come. Some of they can only come with time experience, But I do sinceum let me see a couple more minutes of your time. Are you able to pull up the flashcard? Like do you have access or recording?
00:39:26
Let's try to get me to make sure I have access because I really want to be as self- sufficient as possible. Um, so I should just be able to go to MySource, right? And then from MySource, I put in" flashcard."
00:39:38
Yeah, actually if you go on the MySource and just scroll down on the homepage, flashcards are right there. Um. Sometimes link doesn't work great though. So I can give you my most recent flashcard if need be. Then we'll just talk through it real quick.
00:39:56
Alright, so you said, and my sort of scroll down. Hold on, it's loading. These batteries in these laptops are not great. They did not last.
00:40:10
You definitely, yeah, you definitely got to have it plugged in when you're home working. You got two monitors? Three, good man, good man.
00:40:18
I got two I went and bought an extra one to go with the one I have. But now, in total, I have three if we count the laptop. Only thing is I don't have is a switcher to because I gotta keep I gotta plug in more than one and only have one HDMI input.
00:40:38
Ah, gotcha.
00:40:40
But I don't have a dock, I guess that's another thing another way of saying it. Yeah, I don't have a dock. Um. We'll see. Alright so let's go down. 
00:40:53
And do I go down to pricing flashcards? Yeah, you see it. Yeah,
00:41:00
Click on that and see if it comes up.
00:41:05
Yep, takes me to yep acquisition cam flashcards loyalty flashcards.
00:41:12
Acquisition, let's see.
00:41:18
Access denied.
00:41:22
Bro, what is up with this? I've been here for a while.
00:41:26
It's been doing that to me a little bit too. So let me. This is the most recent and nothing is going to change in a while, So I am going to send you this and see if you can open it. Alright, I'm posting it in T. Oh, she said you don't have permission. Alright, so I'm gonna download it.
00:41:51
Damn it. Right. Bro. Oh, there's so much to do in this damn job. It's insanity.
00:42:19
All Right, I'm waiting on. Oh, you're not it to come through.
00:42:26
I shared one, but so the first one you probably don't have access to. The second one though is straight from me, so see if you can open it. It should pop up here. See if you can open that second one.
00:42:39
Yes. Wait. Yep, got it. Um.
00:42:54
So you got all your single plays, you got all your multi multi plays. I want you got double plays in here too, Or no, they're all just multiple plays by two year three year month to month.
00:43:07
Yeah yeah let me uh let. 
00:43:10
Me show you. So here's how you read this ridiculous thing.
00:43:20
Okay are you sharing your screen okay? Yeah. 
00:43:23
You got multiplay and single play. Single play, internet only. Multiplay, multiplay is internet and one phone line. So when you see the price, it's internet and one phone line. Each additional phone line, twenty five dollars each. TV is additional like anything you add on is added onto the price. But, when you see multiplay these prices, which this is the price that's going to show up on your SOA this year. One are with a phone line, internet and a phone line. Phone lines do carry a lot of tax I mean having phone lines just like. About twenty bucks in tax. Um, and it really carries no tax. We live in Washington state; they love taxes. Um, so two- year multiplayum for eight hundredum. So I just said," I just said you have three people in line in front of you." I'll call you back Soon.
00:44:23
All right. Um,
00:44:25
So, as you can see, so let's just take let's just take a five hundred meg sale price. You can do the sales to new customers. You see how it's one seventy seven? Yeah. If we go down to the single play two year for the same thing, It is one sixty two T. Here is basically a fifteen dollars difference between a phone line and no phone line. Okay. So, all of the multiplays will be fifteen dollars more than their corresponding single plays. Here is how you read this. So let's say they want to do three year single play. For a brand new customer, you can do the sale QVP or the standard. You can sell either one of these for a renewal, you can only do this one. So someone's renewing, upgrading, whatever they already have account, you can do this.
00:45:21
Now it's this price plus the equipment equals this price, and this is the price you'll see. Okay. Forty-two seconds. Plus tax? Hey girl, plus tax, yeah. I don't know, but the card should be in that middle console. Yeah, and just a kickback. So when you click the loyalty and click kickback, run the card into it.
00:45:50
Okay. Um, so premium is if they already have us. Standard or sales is this. You can see up here that there like you don't have any sales, Right? And then you have a standard that comes with connection pro. Never sell this. It's uh it's basically I mean it's extra but connection pro is dumb. Connection pro is terrible. Wireless Connect, which is the next generation of Connected Pro, is fantastic. Right? So we wouldn't even sell Connected Pro anymore. As far as we're concerned, it doesn't exist. So that's why you see two standards, two premiums because one of them is bundled with Connected Pro. They are coming out with bundles for Security Edge Preferred, Which will be fantastic because it will get our multiplier up for extra commissions because it's an add- on and it's.
00:46:47
Cybersecurity for customers, so that's great.
00:46:50
Okay. Okay. What. 
00:47:11
Is what do you find okay? Okay, I got this part. I can read this chart.
00:47:16
For the most part, so I just got to get in. I got to just get imbibed in it. It's got to get in my system.
00:47:24
Something super super important to note that uh, you don't get gift cards with the sale UVP. Sale no gift cards, standard gift cards, but you can see standard is thirty dollars more right? So is it worth a gift card? Don't know, but that's something to remember rightum. 
00:47:45
And what happens if somebody cancels early, on their on their contract. Are they responsible for the remainder.
00:47:52
No, just uh it's basically thirty five dollars for every month left. Okay. So a lot less than other telecoms, a lot of other telecoms will you know, maybe have seventy five percent of what's remaining or pay the whole is remaining.
00:48:05
Right. Okay.
00:48:10
All right.
00:48:18
Right, I think I got this part. So, what do you want me? What are you saying then? If you feel you want me to on my downtime, you want me to go out in the field.
00:48:29
Probably. I'll go, I'll go knocking with you on Wednesday after our all hands meeting. On our way back, we'll hit some doors justum what time is our all hands?

00:49:00
Uh no all hands does. Okay. We only do it once a quarter.
00:49:06
Okay. So I need to let my trainer know I'll be out a day.
00:49:13
Yeah He'll probably be like, Velocity is more important. I don't know. Let me let me ask Sharnae. Yes, okay, so she Josiah's got an issue, a very bad one. Um, I'll call. I gotta go.
