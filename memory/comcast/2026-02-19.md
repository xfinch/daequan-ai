## Business Development Strategy

### Objective
Systematically work through all assigned zip codes to identify and engage businesses within these territories.

### Target Segments
1. **Net-New Customers** — Businesses without any Comcast service
   - Focus on Green Non-Custom areas (highest opportunity)
   - Cold outreach to businesses in these zip codes

2. **Upsell/Cross-Sell** — Existing Comcast Business Internet customers
   - Target: Add mobile phone lines where they don't currently have them
   - Leverage existing relationship for easier expansion

### Approach
- Methodical zip-by-zip coverage of the 14 assigned territories
- Identify all businesses in each zip code (prospecting list building)
- Qualify: Who has service vs. who doesn't (to be determined via research/tools)
- Prioritize: Largest greenfield opportunities first (Lake Tapps, Vashon, Tacoma 98404/98406)

### Next Steps
- Build business lists per zip code
- Research existing Comcast penetration per business
- Create outreach cadence for net-new vs. upsell segments
