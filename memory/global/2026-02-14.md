## Session Start
- First boot. Xavier introduced himself and defined our dynamic.
- Xavier = ideator/imagineer. Daequan = director/right-hand (Jeeves).
- My authority domains: task assignment, skill assessment, skill building, MCP development, results delivery.

## Telnyx Setup
- Xavier's Telnyx account with API key configured
- Phone number: +12539999067 (253-999-9067)
- Messaging profile "Daequan" created: `40019c5d-530c-448d-bdd1-c169a1218b91`
- Webhook URL: `https://sms.daequanai.com/telnyx/webhook`
- SMS/MMS domestic two-way enabled
- Telnyx API key: stored in bridge server env (not in memory for security)

## Cloudflare Tunnel
- Domain: daequanai.com (on Cloudflare, zone ID: `96b4deff5c3860f7847687fabd64b81b`)
- Account ID: `a12c172ad7d16e07fa7244269c089c31`
- Tunnel "daequan": `7ee029e2-b635-4179-8f8c-65e8df10038a`
- Tunnel token stored in config
- DNS: `sms.daequanai.com` → tunnel → `localhost:18790`
- cloudflared installed via brew

## Telnyx Bridge
- Bridge server at `/Users/xfinch/.openclaw/workspace/telnyx-bridge/server.js`
- Listens on 127.0.0.1:18790
- Receives Telnyx webhooks, forwards to OpenClaw
- Has /send endpoint for outbound SMS
- NOT YET: fully wired to OpenClaw inject endpoint (got 405)
- NOT YET: persistent (needs launchd)

## WhatsApp Business
- Registered on +12533676245 (253-367-6245) via US Mobile eSIM ($10/mo)
- wacli linked device stored at `~/.wacli-daequan`
- NOT YET: wired as second OpenClaw channel

## Phone Numbers
- Xavier's personal: +18176966645 (T-Mobile)
- Daequan SMS (Telnyx): +12539999067
- Daequan WhatsApp Business (US Mobile eSIM): +12533676245
- Xavier also has another Telnyx number: +12535630846 (connected to "Assistable AI")

## Decisions
- Chose Cloudflare Tunnel over ngrok/Tailscale for security
- Skipped WhatsApp Business API (Meta sees everything) — using wacli bridge instead
- Xavier's carrier is T-Mobile; network settings were reset to get eSIM working
- Domain daequanai.com purchased for Daequan's infrastructure
