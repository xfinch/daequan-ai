## Power Management Fix
- Fixed Mac mini sleep issue causing WhatsApp gateway disconnects
- Updated power settings: `sudo pmset -a sleep 30 networkoversleep 1`  
- System now sleeps after 30 minutes instead of 1 minute
- Network connections can prevent sleep (keeps WhatsApp gateway alive)
- Should eliminate the 408 timeout cycles we were seeing

## WhatsApp Onboarding Completion

## Business Context (from Xavier's audio)
- **Traffic Link** = Xavier's agency/white label operation (LLC since 2020)
- **Assistable AI** = Current platform providing "Travis AI" (phone-connected AI)
- **Vision** = Replace Assistable backend with Daequan + phone integration
- **Recent transition** = Left Nasdaq Senior SWE role (laid off for not keeping up with team demands)
- **Background** = Graphic designer → marketing → web dev → software engineer → entrepreneur
- **Goal** = Xavier as ideator/client-facing, Daequan as technical executor
